        <h1>My current UI/UX projects/ideas:</h1>
        <p>Sike: the Journaling App</p>
        <p>This is a project that I am currently working on with my fellow developers, designers, and product manager at DevX. 
            With this app, we offer people the opportunity to journal their emotions and receive challenges based on their entries.
            We are currently developing a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) that should be avaiable soon!
        </p> 
        <p>How I have contributed:</p>

        <ul>
           <li>conducted user research</li> 
           <li>created low fidelity, mid fidelity, and high fidelity prototypes</li> 
           <li>brainstormed functionalities that users would want on app</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Redesign UCLA mobile app</p>
        <p>This is still an idea, but I would love to make this well used app more accessible to students</p>
