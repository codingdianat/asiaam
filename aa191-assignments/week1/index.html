                <p>I am currently a second year at UCLA majoring in Cognitive Science with a specialization in computing and minoring in Digital Humanities. As a 
                    critical digital mapmaker, my main goal is to create maps that amplify the experiences 
                    of minority communities. As I progress through out this course, I hope to better intersect the experiences
                    of communities with technology, specifically maps. Outside of this course, I am working towards becoming 
                    a User Experience Designer! By being a part of DevX, a development and design club at UCLA, I get to sharpen my
                    design skills! I also love to play Valorant.... my main is Sova.
